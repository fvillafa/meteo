The purpose of this is to keep the code of a very simple meteorological station
built using Arduino and three sensors (Temperature, Pressure & Humidity).
Most of the code is based in third party code or REALLY simple code.

This is here for backup as I've lost the code for this two times already. And
despite of being super easy to hack, I'm lazy to do it everytime I want it :)
